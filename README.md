This is my journey of learning Graphic programming I am started with Opengl and I already had some experince coding in c++ but it was dusty So this is also my fresh start as I am Studying in Software engineer which I was learning about coding Java and HTML CSS JS
Which I got the basic and understanding how do code works and how to think. After I have learned doing object-Oriented so (Java) I did made a little game which is like a text game which was on the second semister junior year,


Why do I wanted to do GRAPHIC Programming? 


I felt bored in html I never good at it, nor like it. Felt like it doesn't spark a joy of my ADHD personal which craving to learn something fun which I was burned out because html JS which is doing the mostly front-end I'm not great good at make a good design or do so
but I been playing RB6, Minecraft I was Interesting how it was render at first I was interest how it would render. and I have found Acerola videos which sparks something in me which I was looking for about because I'm was thinking what my career journey will be
I did slips into something else many times like doing racing and stuff. but thats not the point! now this is spark me a joy and I was looking for a project to working on and this is close to what I like which is VIDEO GAMES!
:)
